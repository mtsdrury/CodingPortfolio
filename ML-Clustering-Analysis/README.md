# Machine Learning Clustering Analysis

Welcome to the repository for the Clustering Analysis project, which focuses on employing machine learning techniques to effectively categorize documents based on word usage patterns. This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the application of advanced clustering algorithms to achieve optimal grouping of textual data.

## Project Overview

This project is structured around the development and implementation of a clustering algorithm tailored to handle high-dimensional data typically found in text documents. The core of the analysis revolves around an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, assessing various initialization strategies to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the final clustering results.

## Features

- **Expectation-Maximization Algorithm:** Implementation of the EM algorithm to maximize the likelihood of the underlying generative model for document clusters.
- **Accuracy Optimization:** Use of permutation testing to evaluate and enhance the accuracy of the cluster assignments.
- **Robust Initialization:** Investigation into the effects of different initialization techniques on the stability and quality of clustering.
