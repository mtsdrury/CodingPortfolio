# Cellular Automata Simulation

This project simulates cellular automata, focusing on the interaction between cells based on predefined rules and states. It uses a hybrid approach that combines elements of both discrete and continuous modeling.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several components, each serving a specific role:

- **`automata.c`** & **`automata.h`**: Contain the core logic for the cellular automata, including state definitions and transition rules.
- **`automaton`**: The main executable generated by compiling the source files, responsible for running the simulation.
- **`input`**: Stores the initial values for all cells, serving as the starting point for the simulation.
- **`out`**: Stores the output from the simulation, showing the state of each cell with specific symbols.
- **`priority_queue.c`** & **`priority_queue.h`**: Implement a priority queue used for managing the order in which cell states are updated, ensuring correct simulation flow.
- **`Makefile`**: Contains commands for compiling the project, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly built.
- **`FinalAssignment - Automata.pdf`**: Provides the assignment document detailing project requirements, specifications, and guidelines.

## Directory Structure

- **Source Files**: Includes `automata.c`, `priority_queue.c`, and their respective header files.
- **Executable**: The `automaton` file that would theoretically execute the simulation.
- **Data Files**: `input` and `out` for initial states and results of the simulation.
- **Documentation**: The PDF file detailing the project's academic or theoretical background.
